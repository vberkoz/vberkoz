### **Introduction**

> Serverless is more than a buzzword—it's a powerful model that lets developers focus on writing code without worrying about infrastructure. In this post, I’ll walk through how I use AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB together to build scalable, cost-efficient backends for real-world projects like **Driver-Sync** and **Car-Keeper**.

### **Why Serverless?**

* No server maintenance
* Built-in scalability
* Event-driven execution
* Pay-as-you-go pricing
* Seamless integration with AWS ecosystem

### **Architecture Overview**

> A typical architecture I use looks like this:

* **Client (React/React Native)** → **API Gateway** → **Lambda Functions** → **DynamoDB**
* Authentication handled with **AWS Cognito**
* File uploads go through **S3 signed URLs**

Include a diagram (optional) with arrows showing the flow.

### **API Gateway + Lambda**

* I use **AWS CDK** or **SST** to define APIs.
* Each route maps to a Lambda function or handler inside a monolithic app using Express.js or `aws-lambda-router`.

Sample code:

```ts
// Lambda handler using Express.js
app.get("/drivers", async (req, res) => {
  const data = await db.queryDrivers();
  res.json(data);
});
```

### **Working with DynamoDB**

* Store structured and unstructured data
* Use single-table design where practical
* Strongly recommend defining access patterns before schema

Sample schema:

```json
{
  "PK": "DRIVER#123",
  "SK": "PROFILE",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "license": "ABC123"
}
```

### **Performance & Cost Optimization**

* Cold start mitigation tips
* Use provisioned concurrency if needed
* Keep Lambda payloads small
* Use batch writes for DynamoDB

### **Common Pitfalls & Fixes**

* CORS issues? Define exact origins in API Gateway
* Hitting DynamoDB limits? Use exponential backoff with retries
* Need relational data? Integrate with **RDS Proxy** when needed

### **Real Project Use Case: Driver-Sync**

* Mobile pre-trip inspection app
* Uses Cognito for login
* APIs for vehicle assignment, reporting, and checklist syncing
* All backed by Lambda + DynamoDB + S3

### **Conclusion**

> AWS serverless tools like Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB enable developers to ship fast, scale painlessly, and maintain less infrastructure. With careful planning and the right patterns, serverless becomes a productivity multiplier.
